inversions_breakpoints_simulation \n
Contains the scripts for simulating breakpoints and permutations

Produces random breakpoints along the sequence. Used 
breakpoint_generator.py

Produces random breakpoints in the strata boundaries
strata_constraint_breakpoint_generator.py

Breaks a sequence at random breakpoints generated by breakpoint_generator.py.
It generates a permutation which can then be sorted by Baobabluna to count the 
number of classes and traces.
reversal_pipeline.sh

Breaks a sequence at the strata constrained breakpoints generated by
strata_constraint_breakpoint_generator.py. It generates a permutation with 
breakpoints constrained to the strata boundaries. This can then be sorted by 
Baobabluna to count the number of classes and traces.
strata_constraint_reversal_pipeline.sh

It takes the output of reversal_pipeline.sh and strata_constraint_reversal_pipeline.sh
and run baobabluna analyzeTraces to get the count of classes and traces. The script
further parses the output for baobabluna analyzeTraces. 
processing_simulations.sh
