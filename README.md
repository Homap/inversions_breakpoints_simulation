## inversions_breakpoints_simulation
### Contains the scripts for simulating breakpoints and permutations

Produces random breakpoints along the sequence.

```breakpoint_generator.py```

Produces random breakpoints in the strata boundaries
```strata_constraint_breakpoint_generator.py```

Breaks a sequence at random breakpoints generated by breakpoint_generator.py.
It generates a permutation which can then be sorted by Baobabluna to count the 
number of classes and traces.

```reversal_pipeline.sh```

Breaks a sequence at the strata constrained breakpoints generated by
strata_constraint_breakpoint_generator.py. It generates a permutation with 
breakpoints constrained to the strata boundaries. This can then be sorted by 
Baobabluna to count the number of classes and traces.

```strata_constraint_reversal_pipeline.sh```

It takes the output of reversal_pipeline.sh and strata_constraint_reversal_pipeline.sh
and run baobabluna analyzeTraces to get the count of classes and traces. The script
further parses the output for baobabluna analyzeTraces. 

```processing_simulations.sh```
